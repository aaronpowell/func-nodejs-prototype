# Option 3

Decorators! We have two options:

- [TypeScript Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html): These are experimental, but somewhat commonly used. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to become non-experimental because Node.js decorators will be recommended eventually instead
- [Node.js Decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators): Currently a Stage 3 proposal. No idea when it will be finalized, but this will likely be the long term future of decorators in Node.js.
