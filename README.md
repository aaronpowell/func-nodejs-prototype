# ✨ New ✨ programming model for Node.js Azure Functions

See [this rollup issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-worker/issues/480) for more information on our general goals and plan of action. This repo specifically contains prototypes for the last bullet point in the "plan of action".

## Code in this repo

This repo has several different options, each following this general format:

- `Option#/src/main.ts`: The main entrypoint for a sample TypeScript app
- `Option#/types/index.d.ts`: Types for a new [programming model package](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-nodejs-worker/issues/568)

The README in each "Option" folder has more details about each option
